# COVID-19-Crisis-In-India-Visualization-And-Analysis

The project uses Python's various data processing and visualization libraries. Using them I have created various visualizations like Filled Maps, Heat Maps, Tree Maps, Bar Charts, 
Line Charts, Tables, etc. 

They have been formed after processing, filtering, aqnd working on the data from various csv files downloaded from sources across the internet provided in the zip file above. 

## Main Insights:
  1. I have analyzed how the COVID-19 virus **spread across the world** beginning from 22nd Jan, 2020 to 30th Jun, 2021, and which countries were affected the most and at what time.
  2. I have analyzed which **Indian states were the worst affected by the pandemic** and as of 30th Jun, 2020 how many Green, Orange, and Red Zones does India have.
  3. The state by state analysis have also been provided through a time plot alongwith a tree map as well.
  4. To further get a sense of worst hit areas in India a heat map has been used which seems quite intuitive and informative.
  5. The Indian maps have also been visualized as a time plot with the same date range as of the world map.
  6. Line Charts have been used to **track the Confirmed, Active, and Death** cases in India as well as across some worst hit states.
  7. Tables have also been used along with conditional formatting in the form of bars to provide a sense of the above mentioned point.
  8. I have also analyzed as to how the states are performing in terms of **samples tested**, and how the districts across them have been categorized into the 3 zones.
  9. At last, I have plotted a trajectory of COVID-19 in form of a log scale (New Cofnirmed Cases vs Total Number of Cases) for the owrst hit states.
  10. This has been followed by the performance analysis of the **states that went into election namely, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, and Assam** to analyze how the **elections affected thier trajectory**.
